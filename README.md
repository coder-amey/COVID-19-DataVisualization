# COVID-19-DataVisualization  
## History and purpose of this repository:
* The original repository by this name (**COVID-19-DataVisualization**) was created as a sandbox for visualizing and plotting data related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
* It evolved into a robust tracker and was subsequently renamed as **COVID-19-Tracker**.  
* This repository maintains the directory structure of the original repository, as it was at the time this repository was created, and serves to redirect any HTTP requests which are made to the tracker using its old address.  
* This repository also houses some basic visualization programmes which were created in the early stages of development.
